### Welcome to my github!

#### About me:
Iâ€™m an August 2024 graduate of MITâ€™s Masterâ€™s of Business Analytics (MBAn) program, with a focus on Machine Learning, AI, and Data Science at MITâ€™s Operations Research Center. At MIT, I conducted research advised by Prof. Dimitris Bertsimas and worked for Lineage Logistics and Pfizer. Previously, I studied Systems Engineering, Government, and Computer Science at the University of Virginia. 

This fall, I am actively seeking a full-time role building data-driven software products with ML. If youâ€™d like to get in contact, please reach out to me at hratliff@mit.edu.

#### Interests:
AI/ML, optimization, healthcare improvement, logistics optimization, and data-driven policymaking.

#### About this page:
Most of my academic code is private, but I'm currently working on a variety of projects that will be public soon. Stay tuned!
