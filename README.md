### Welcome to my github!

My name is Hayden, and I'm currently a student at the University of Virginia. I consider myself proficient in Python, Java, and C++, and I dabble in C, x86 assembly, and SQL. I also enjoy using Excel solver for smaller optimization problems.

All of my school-related code is in a private repository to comply with UVA's honor policy, but I love sharing my code portfolio with people interested in checking it out - please shoot me an email at haydenratliff@virginia.edu and I can share it with you or send you it in a zipped folder.

Otherwise, stay tuned for a variety of other projects that will be public soon!
